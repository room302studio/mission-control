# Mission Control

Welcome to **Mission Control** â€“ your cyberpunk-themed dashboard for visualizing Netlify deploys, GitHub activity, and project milestones in the style of an '80s digital dreamscape. Dive into the neon-lit world of your codebase, track the progress of your most active projects, monitor open pull requests, and celebrate milestones with a glow.
